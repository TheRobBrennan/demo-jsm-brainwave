# Welcome

A greenfield project to explore ideas presented in [Build and Deploy a Modern UI/UX Website with React & Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B91wc5dCEBA)

## Getting started

Here is my cheat sheet to get started with the initial setup for our project:

```sh
# Install Tailwind CSS with Vite - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

## Create a new Vite project
npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react

```
